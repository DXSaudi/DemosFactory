## What is Demos Factory

Hello, welcome to Demos Factory, a repository where you will find some cool demos to learn and use cutting-edge Microsoft related technologies such as Azure, Windows 10, Bot Framework, Cognitive Services and many more.

We tried to write very detailed documentation for the demos so anyone can follow it and utilize it in their projects / POCs, however, some of these demos require advanced technical knowledge. 

The scenarios in Demos Factory are not focusing on how complicated or advanced they are from technological perspective, instead we focused on a complete end-to-end business case that demonstrate a use of one or more technology area. 


## The Demos

Currently we have the following demos fully produced from the factory and ready to be followed / used.

 **1. Cognitive Services Showcase:** This cool demo is built based on [Kiosk project](https://github.com/Microsoft/Cognitive-Samples-IntelligentKiosk) . It contain 3 scenarios:


 - FaceLook: Age and Gender Detection 
 - Emotionizer: A simple game to challenge your friend who shows a random emotion better than the other. 
 - SurpriseMe: It detects your gender and age and suggest to you one of Microsoft's products.


**2. Web Apps on Linux using Docker:** Build your own upload center using Docker image using Azure Web Apps on Linux

**3. Open Source DevOps:** Build PHP development environment connected to Azure with full DevOps scenario.

**4. How Old Bot:** Building a bot that is connected to Azure Cognitive Services to guess the user age & gender.
